00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Section 5.4: Sketching Graphs. Let's learn how

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.420
to identify key features and sketch functions.

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.761
Every graph has key features you should label:

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:21.302
intercepts. vertices. and asymptotes. Let's identify them.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.128
The y-intercept is where the graph crosses the

6
00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:27.708
y-axis. Here it's at 0 comma 2.

7
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:32.014
The x-intercepts are where the graph crosses the x-axis.

8
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:36.137
The vertex is the highest or lowest point. This

9
00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:39.281
parabola has a maximum at 1 comma 3.

10
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:50.098
A vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator equals zero. For f of x equals

11
00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:55.414
2 over x minus 3. the denominator is zero when x equals 3.

12
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.817
Watch how the graph shoots off towards positive

13
00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.553
and negative infinity near x equals 3.

14
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.066
The vertical asymptote is the dashed red line at x equals

15
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.566
3. The graph gets closer and closer but never touches it.

16
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.803
Case 1: when numerator and denominator have the same

17
00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:24.939
degree. the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of leading

18
00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.425
coefficients. Here. y equals 3 over 2.

19
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:32.688
Case 2: when the numerator has a lower degree than

20
00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:38.134
the denominator. the horizontal asymptote is always y equals 0.

21
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.855
Case 3: when the numerator has a

22
00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:44.988
higher degree. there is no horizontal asymptote.

23
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:57.429
To find where two graphs intersect. set them equal to each other. Here

24
00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:02.569
we have y equals negative x squared and y equals 2x minus 1.

25
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:07.999
Set negative x squared equal to 2x minus 1. Rearrange to

26
00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.753
get x squared plus 2x minus 1 equals 0. Using the

27
00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:18.574
quadratic formula. x equals negative 1 plus or minus root 2.

28
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:26.529
In optimization problems. we find the vertex of a

29
00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.841
parabola. Here. profit P depends on quantity q.

30
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.932
The profit function is a downward-opening parabola.

31
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.929
The vertex is at q equals 235 with a maximum profit of 684 dollars

32
00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:48.532
and 50 cents. This is found using q equals negative b over 2a.

33
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:55.571
IB exam tip: follow a systematic checklist when sketching.

34
00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:01.080
Step 1: find vertical asymptotes. Step 2: find horizontal

35
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.912
asymptotes using the degree rule. Step 3: find the

36
00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:11.614
intercepts. Step 4: connect everything into a smooth curve.
