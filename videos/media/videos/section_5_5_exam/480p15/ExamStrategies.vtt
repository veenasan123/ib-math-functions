00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.672
Section 5.5: Exam Strategies. Let's review the key

2
00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:08.108
techniques you need for the IB exam.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.028
In context problems. the inverse has real-world meaning. A company's

4
00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:21.900
profit is P of n equals 40n minus 130.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.947
Find P inverse of 1790. This means: how many

6
00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:32.340
items must be sold to earn 1790 dollars profit?

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.408
Set 40n minus 130 equal to 1790. Add 130 to get

8
00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:46.820
40n equals 1920. Divide by 40: n equals 48 items.

9
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:57.066
Company A charges 35n dollars. Company B charges 40n

10
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.998
minus 130 dollars. When is Company A cheaper?

11
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:09.297
Set up the inequality: 35n less than 40n minus 130. Subtract 40n

12
00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:15.881
from both sides to get negative 5n less than negative 130.

13
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:20.562
Now here's the critical step everyone forgets: when you divide

14
00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:24.833
by a negative number. you must FLIP the inequality sign!

15
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.328
So n is greater than 26. Company A is

16
00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:32.201
cheaper when more than 26 items are sold.

17
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:41.642
Finding the range of a restricted function requires checking endpoints and

18
00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:46.514
behaviour near asymptotes. Consider g of x equals 3 minus 12

19
00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:50.249
over x plus 3 on the interval negative 9 to 9.

20
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.355
There's a vertical asymptote at x equals negative

21
00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:57.500
3. The graph splits into two branches.

22
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.942
Evaluating the endpoints: g of negative 9 equals 5. and g of

23
00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:09.740
9 equals 2. The horizontal asymptote is at y equals 3.

24
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:14.724
The range is y less than or equal to 2. or y greater than

25
00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:19.942
or equal to 5. The values between 2 and 5 are never reached.

26
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:26.990
One more recap of the big trick. Solve g of

27
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.465
x equals g inverse of x for this function.

28
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:36.857
Use the trick: solve g of x equals x. So 2x plus ln of x

29
00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:43.969
minus 2 equals x. Simplify to x plus ln of x minus 2 equals 0.

30
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:50.233
This can't be solved algebraically. so use your TI-84 calculator.

31
00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:55.289
The answer is x equals 2.28 to 3 significant figures.

32
00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.658
Mistake 1: forgetting to show your

33
00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:05.486
substitution steps. Always show your working!

34
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:08.477
Mistake 2: not flipping the inequality

35
00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.121
sign when dividing by a negative.

36
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.873
Mistake 3: writing f inverse as 1 over f.

37
00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:20.028
Remember. it's the inverse function. not the reciprocal.

38
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:23.362
Mistake 4: missing domain restrictions

39
00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:26.758
from roots. fractions. and logarithms.

40
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.164
Mistake 5: forgetting to draw

41
00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:32.988
asymptotes when sketching rational functions.

42
00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:36.614
Good luck on your IB exam! You've got this!
