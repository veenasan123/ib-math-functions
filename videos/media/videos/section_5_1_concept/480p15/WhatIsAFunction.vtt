Welcome to section 5.1: Concept of a

2
00:00:03.385 --> 00:00:06.860
Function. Let's start with the basics.

3
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:16.096
Think of a function as a machine. You feed in an input x. a rule

4
00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:22.457
is applied. and an output comes out. Here. the rule is 2x plus 5.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.196
If we put in x equals 2. we get 2 times 2 plus 5. which equals 9.

6
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.595
If we put in x equals negative 3. we get

7
00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:36.966
2 times negative 3 plus 5. which equals negative 1.

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.237
In proper notation. we write f of x

9
00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:47.052
equals 2x plus 5. Let's break this down.

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.367
f is the name of the function. x is the input variable. And 2x

11
00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:56.700
plus 5 is the rule that tells us what to do with x.

12
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.472
To find f of 2. we replace every x with 2. So we get

13
00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:08.244
2 times 2 plus 5. which is 4 plus 5. which equals 9.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.960
Now for a reverse problem. If f of x equals 3x

15
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.140
minus 2. find x when f of x equals 13.

16
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:27.286
We set 3x minus 2 equal to 13. Add 2 to both sides to

17
00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:33.406
get 3x equals 15. Divide by 3 and we find x equals 5.

18
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:44.313
A rational function has a fraction with x in the denominator. Here.

19
00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:47.969
g of x equals 2x plus 3 over x minus 4.

20
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:54.451
Substituting x equals 2: the numerator is 7. the denominator

21
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:59.265
is negative 2. so g of 2 equals negative 3.5.

22
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.943
But be careful! The denominator cannot equal zero. So x minus 4 cannot

23
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:11.732
be zero. meaning x cannot be 4. This is a domain restriction.

24
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:18.722
IB exam tip: always show your substitution step. You earn method

25
00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:23.697
marks even if the final answer is wrong. Never skip steps!
