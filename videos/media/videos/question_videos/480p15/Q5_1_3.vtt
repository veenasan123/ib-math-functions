00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.188
Question 5.1.3. Question 3. Concept of a Function.

2
00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:12.528
If h(x) equals 2^x plus 3. find:

3
00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:15.868
h(1)

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:22.329
Substitute x equals 1 into h(x) equals 2^x plus 3.

5
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:29.017
h(1) equals 2 to the 1 plus 3 equals 2 plus 3 equals 5

6
00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.820
h(1) equals 5

7
00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:35.926
h(0)

8
00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:42.828
Remember: any number to the power of 0 is 1. so 2 to the 0 equals 1.

9
00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:49.700
h(0) equals 2 to the 0 plus 3 equals 1 plus 3 equals 4

10
00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:52.654
h(0) equals 4

11
00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.062
h(-1)

12
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:01.873
Negative exponent: 2 inverse equals 1 over 2.

13
00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:07.332
h(-1) equals 2 inverse plus 3 equals 1 over

14
00:01:07.432 --> 00:01:11.790
2 plus 3 equals 7 over 2 equals 3.5

15
00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:17.356
h(-1) equals 7 over 2 equals 3.5

16
00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:25.312
IB exam tip: Know your exponent rules: a to the 0 equals 1.

17
00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:31.956
a inverse equals 1 over a. These come up frequently in IB exams.
