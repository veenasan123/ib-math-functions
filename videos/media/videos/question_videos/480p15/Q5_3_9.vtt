00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.068
Question 5.3.9. Question 9. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.268
Let h(x) equals log(7 - 3x).

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.140
Find the largest possible domain of h.

4
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.718
The argument of log must be > 0.

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.652
7 - 3x > 0

6
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.185
negative 3x > negative 7

7
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.774
When dividing by a negative number. flip the inequality sign!

8
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.358
x < 7 over 3

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.732
Domain: x < 7 over 3

10
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.606
Find h inverse(2).

11
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:47.121
Set h(x) equals 2 and solve for x.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.012
log(7 - 3x) equals 2

13
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:55.358
7 - 3x equals 10 squared equals 100

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.540
negative 3x equals 93

15
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.212
x equals negative 31

16
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.318
h inverse(2) equals negative 31

17
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.658
IB exam tip: The most common mistake: forgetting to flip

18
00:01:11.758 --> 00:01:16.310
the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative.
