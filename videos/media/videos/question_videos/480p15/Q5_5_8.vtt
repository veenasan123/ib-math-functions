Question 5.5.8. Question 8. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.844
A function is defined by g(x) equals 2x plus natural

3
00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:17.396
log of(x - 2). This question is worth 7 marks.

4
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:23.041
State the domain and range of g. [2 marks]

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.908
For natural log of(x-2) to be defined: x - 2 > 0 . therefore. x > 2.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.586
As x maps to 2^ plus . natural log

7
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:41.332
of(x-2) maps to -infinity. so g(x) maps to -infinity.

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.556
As x maps to infinity. g(x) maps to infinity.

9
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.628
Domain: x > 2. Range: y in the real numbers (all real numbers).

10
00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:00.010
Sketch y equals g(x) and y equals g

11
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.545
inverse(x) on the same axes. [3 marks]

12
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.486
g has a vertical asymptote at x equals 2.

13
00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:14.406
Key point: g(3) equals 6 plus 0 equals 6.

14
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:20.558
g(x): through (3. 6) with VA x equals 2.

15
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.268
g inverse(x): through (6. 3) with HA y equals 2.

16
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.950
Draw both curves reflected in y equals x.

17
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.761
with y equals x as dashed line.

18
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:42.206
Solve g(x) equals g inverse(x). [2 marks]

19
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:51.473
g(x) equals g inverse(x) occurs on y equals x. So solve g(x) equals x.

20
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:56.113
2x plus natural log of(x-2) equals x

21
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.588
x plus natural log of(x-2) equals 0

22
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:05.678
Using TI-84: x approximately 2.12.

23
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:12.833
x approximately 2.12. Point: (2.12. 2.12).

24
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.218
IB exam tip: Intersection of f and f inverse always occurs on

25
00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:25.284
the line y equals x. This is a classic IB exam question!
