00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.668
Question 5.5.6. Question 6. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.354
A function is defined by f(x) equals square root of x plus 1x squared

3
00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:19.500
- 4 for negative 1 less than or equal to x less than or

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.300
equal to 5.\ x not equal to 2. This question is worth 6 marks.

5
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.326
Find the range of f. [4 marks]

6
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:35.855
Analyse the function behaviour. VA at x equals 2 (within

7
00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:40.854
domain). x equals negative 2 is outside the domain.

8
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:46.665
f(-1) equals square root of 01-4 equals 0

9
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:52.241
As x maps to 2^-: numerator maps to square root of

10
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:57.961
3. denominator maps to 0^-. so f maps to -infinity.

11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.799
As x maps to 2^ plus : numerator maps to square root of

12
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.236
3. denominator maps to 0^ plus . so f maps to plus infinity.

13
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:17.424
f(5) equals square root of 621 approximately 0.117. The

14
00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:23.961
right piece decreases from plus infinity to 0.117.

15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.807
Range: y less than or equal to 0 or y

16
00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:32.348
greater than or equal to square root of 621

17
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:39.294
Find f inverse(2 over 5). [2 marks]

18
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.172
Find x such that f(x) equals 2 over 5.

19
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:49.231
Try x equals 3: f(3) equals square root

20
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:53.646
of 49-4 equals 2 over 5. It works!

21
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.785
f inverse(2 over 5) equals 3

22
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:04.865
IB exam tip: In IB exams. inverse values usually come

23
00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:10.985
out as integers or simple fractions. Try small integers first!
