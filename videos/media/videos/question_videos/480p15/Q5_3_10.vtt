00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.308
Question 5.3.10. Question 10. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:13.614
A function is defined by f(x) equals x to the 3 plus x - 8.

3
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.361
Use technology to sketch y equals f(x).

4
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:25.006
Enter x to the 3 plus x - 8 in Y equals on the TI-84.

5
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.921
Key features: y-intercept at (0. negative

6
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:35.118
8). x-intercept at approximately (1.79. 0).

7
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.092
Cubic curve passing through (0. negative 8) and (1.79. 0).

8
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.340
Sketch y equals f inverse(x) on the same axis.

9
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.934
Reflect in y equals x.

10
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.980
(0. negative 8) maps to (-8. 0) and (1.79. 0) maps to (0. 1.79).

11
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:14.006
Reflected cubic through (-8. 0) and (0. 1.79).

12
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:21.225
Solve f(x) equals f inverse(x).

13
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:28.167
Key insight: f(x) equals f inverse(x) occurs where the graphs

14
00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:33.737
intersect. which must lie on the line y equals x.

15
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.468
So solve f(x) equals x: x to the 3 plus x - 8 equals x

16
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.001
x to the 3 equals 8

17
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.838
x equals 2

18
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.132
f(x) equals f inverse(x) when x equals 2. Point: (2. 2).

19
00:01:55.066 --> 00:02:02.894
IB exam tip: f(x) equals f inverse(x) . therefore. solve f(x)

20
00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:10.302
equals x. This trick saves huge amounts of time in exams!
