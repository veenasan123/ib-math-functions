1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.092
Question 5.4.6. Question 6. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.106
Use technology to find the minimum value of f(x)

3
00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:16.012
equals xe^x. Hence find the range of f.

4
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:23.129
Use TI-84 CALC > minimum to find the lowest point.

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.672
Minimum at x equals negative 1: f(-1) equals (-1)e

6
00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:37.692
inverse equals negative 1 over e approximately negative 0.368

7
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:42.561
Minimum value: negative 1 over e. Range: y greater

8
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.913
than or equal to negative 1 over e

9
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:52.736
IB exam tip: When asked to "find the range". look

10
00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:58.518
for the minimum (or maximum) value using your calculator.
