Question 5.4.11. Question 11. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:12.318
Solve the equation x squared equals 1 over x plus 1.

3
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:20.864
Graph both sides or rearrange: x squared(x plus 1) equals 1 .

4
00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:26.518
therefore. x to the 3 plus x squared - 1 equals 0.

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.068
Graph y equals x to the 3 plus x squared - 1 and find the zero.

6
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.921
x approximately 0.755
