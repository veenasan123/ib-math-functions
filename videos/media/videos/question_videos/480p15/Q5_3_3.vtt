Question 5.3.3. Question 3. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.121
Find the inverse values below.

3
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:17.814
If f(x) equals 3x to the 5. find f inverse(3)

4
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:23.233
Set f(x) equals 3: 3x to the 5 equals 3.

5
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.825
x to the 5 equals 1

6
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.638
x equals 1

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.108
f inverse(3) equals 1

8
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:39.606
If g(x) equals 2x to the 3. find g inverse(16)

9
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:45.585
Set g(x) equals 16: 2x to the 3 equals 16.

10
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.134
x to the 3 equals 8

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.972
x equals 2

12
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.945
g inverse(16) equals 2

13
00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:01.817
IB exam tip: Know your perfect cubes: 1. 8.
