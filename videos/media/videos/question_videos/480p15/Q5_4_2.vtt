00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.972
Question 5.4.2. Question 2. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:12.869
Find the horizontal asymptote of f(x) equals 3x squared

3
00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.353
- x plus 5 over 2x squared plus 4.

4
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.522
When the highest powers in numerator and denominator are the

5
00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.318
same. the HA is the ratio of leading coefficients.

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.581
Both are degree 2. Leading coefficients:

7
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:34.220
3 (numerator) and 2 (denominator).

8
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:38.198
y equals 3 over 2 equals 1.5

9
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.678
Horizontal asymptote: y equals 3 over 2

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.289
IB exam tip: Three cases for HA: same degree →

11
00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:58.469
ratio of leading coefficients; numerator degree < denominator → y

12
00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:04.636
equals 0; numerator degree > denominator → no HA.
