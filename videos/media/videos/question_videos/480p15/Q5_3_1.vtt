Question 5.3.1. Question 1. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:13.473
If f(x) equals 3x plus 5. find f inverse(11).

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.012
f inverse(11) means: what value of x gives f(x) equals 11?

4
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:27.678
Set f(x) equals 11: 3x plus 5 equals 11

5
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.865
3x equals 6

6
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.705
x equals 2

7
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:37.195
Alternative method: find the inverse formula f inverse(x)

8
00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:40.814
equals x-5 over 3. then substitute 11.

9
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.198
f inverse(11) equals 2

10
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:50.098
IB exam tip: f inverse is NOT 1 over f. It

11
00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:54.745
is the reverse function — it undoes what f does.
