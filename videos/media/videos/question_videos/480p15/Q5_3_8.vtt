00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.948
Question 5.3.8. Question 8. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:11.078
Sketch the inverse functions of the following graphs.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.020
y equals cosine(x). 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to pi

4
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:27.065
The inverse of cosine(x) on [0. pi] is arc cosine(x).

5
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:32.644
Key points: (0. 1) maps to (1. 0)

6
00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:39.105
and (pi. negative 1) maps to (-1. pi).

7
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.428
y equals arc cosine(x). domain [-1. 1]. range [0. pi].

8
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.305
Log-type curve from (0. 3)

9
00:00:53.466 --> 00:01:00.566
Reflect in y equals x. (0. 3) maps to (3. 0).

10
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.820
Exponential-type curve from (3. 0).

11
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.676
IB exam tip: The inverse of a log

12
00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:13.641
function is an exponential. and vice versa.
