00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.972
Question 5.4.9. Question 9. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:12.022
Find the coordinates of the point of intersection of y

3
00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:15.393
equals 5 - x squared and y equals e^x.

4
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:22.121
This cannot be solved algebraically — use the graphical calculator.

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.007
Graph both y equals 5 - x squared and

6
00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:30.020
y equals e^x and use CALC > intersect.

7
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:36.086
Intersection at approximately (1.24.\ 3.46)

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.128
IB exam tip: When you see a mix of polynomial and

9
00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:48.772
exponential/log. you'll need the calculator. Don't waste time trying algebra.
