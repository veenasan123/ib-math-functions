Question 5.5.3. Question 3. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:14.366
The radius of a cylindrical container with height x cm is: r(x)

3
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:19.344
equals 56 over x. 4 less than or equal to x less

4
00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:24.633
than or equal to 16 This question is worth 7 marks.

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.540
Find the range of r. [3 marks]

6
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:37.174
r(x) equals 56 over x is a decreasing function on [4. 16].

7
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:42.374
r(4) equals 56 over 4 equals 14

8
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:48.798
r(16) equals 56 over 16 equals 3.5

9
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.726
Since r is decreasing. the range goes

10
00:00:51.826 --> 00:00:54.526
from the largest to smallest value.

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.908
Range: 3.5 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 14

12
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.294
Find r inverse(8). [2 marks]

13
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.620
Set r(x) equals 8 and solve for x.

14
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.566
56 over x equals 8

15
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.478
x equals 56 over 8 equals 7

16
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.721
r inverse(8) equals 7

17
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.686
Find the range of r inverse. [1 mark]

18
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.300
The range of f inverse equals domain of f.

19
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.116
Range of r inverse: 4 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 16

20
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:46.558
Interpret the answer to part (b)(i) in context. [1 mark]

21
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:52.686
When the radius of the container is 8 cm. the height is 7 cm.

22
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.606
IB exam tip: Range of f inverse equals Domain of f. and

23
00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:05.084
Domain of f inverse equals Range of f. This is always true!
