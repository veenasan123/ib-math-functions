00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.852
Question 5.4.8. Question 8. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.823
Find the points of intersection of y equals

3
00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:13.508
-x squared and y equals 2x - 1.

4
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.478
Set the two equations equal to each other.

5
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.433
-x squared equals 2x - 1

6
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.081
x squared plus 2x - 1 equals 0

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:31.628
Using the quadratic formula: x equals negative 2 plus or minus square root

8
00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:36.975
of 4 plus 42 equals negative 2 plus or minus 2square root of

9
00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:41.521
22 equals negative 1 plus or minus square root of 2

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.651
x sub 1 equals negative 1 plus square root of 2

11
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:57.076
approximately 0.41. y sub 1 equals -(0.41)^2 approximately negative 0.17

12
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:02.506
x sub 2 equals negative 1 - square root of 2

13
00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:12.705
approximately negative 2.41. y sub 2 equals -(-2.41)^2 approximately negative 5.83

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.000
(-1 plus square root of 2.\ negative 3 plus 2square root of

15
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.300
2) and (-1-square root of 2.\ negative 3-2square root of 2)

16
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:32.533
IB exam tip: For intersection problems: set equations

17
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:37.798
equal. solve. then substitute back to find y-values.
