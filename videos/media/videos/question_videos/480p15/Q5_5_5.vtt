Question 5.5.5. Question 5. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:13.488
A function is defined by g(x) equals 3 - 12 over x plus 3

3
00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:19.441
for negative 9 less than or equal to x less than or equal to

4
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:25.593
9.\ x not equal to negative 3. This question is worth 5 marks.

5
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.521
Find the range of g. [3 marks]

6
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:35.698
This function has a vertical asymptote at x equals negative

7
00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:40.742
3 and horizontal asymptote y equals 3. Analyse each piece.

8
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.978
Left piece [-9. negative 3): g(-9) equals 3 - 12

9
00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:52.733
over negative 6 equals 3 plus 2 equals 5. As

10
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:59.012
x maps to negative 3^-. g maps to plus infinity.

11
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.046
So on the left: y greater than or equal to 5.

12
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:11.619
Right piece (-3. 9]: As x maps to negative 3^ plus . g maps to

13
00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:19.929
-infinity. g(9) equals 3 - 12 over 12 equals 3 - 1 equals 2.

14
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.740
So on the right: y less than or equal to 2.

15
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.820
Range: y less than or equal to 2 or y greater than or equal to 5

16
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:37.001
Find the value of g inverse(0). [2 marks]

17
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.825
Set g(x) equals 0 and solve.

18
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.678
3 - 12 over x plus 3 equals 0

19
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.921
12 over x plus 3 equals 3

20
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.732
x plus 3 equals 4

21
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.572
x equals 1

22
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.281
g inverse(0) equals 1

23
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.595
IB exam tip: Rational functions with restricted domains: always

24
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:08.132
check both pieces (left and right of the asymptote).
