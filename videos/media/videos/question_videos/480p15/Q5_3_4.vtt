00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.068
Question 5.3.4. Question 4. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.503
Sketch the inverse function of the given

3
00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:14.908
graph (exponential-type curve through (0. negative 1)).

4
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:21.606
To sketch the inverse. reflect the graph in the line y equals x.

5
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:29.534
Key point: (0. negative 1) on f becomes (-1. 0) on f inverse.

6
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.727
The horizontal asymptote y equals negative 1 becomes

7
00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:37.060
a vertical asymptote x equals negative 1.

8
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.811
The inverse is a logarithmic-type curve through (-1.

9
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:46.129
0) with vertical asymptote x equals negative 1.

10
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:52.639
IB exam tip: Always draw the line y equals x first

11
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.686
as a dashed line. then reflect key points. Label them!
