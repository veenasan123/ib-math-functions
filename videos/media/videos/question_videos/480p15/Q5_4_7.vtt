Question 5.4.7. Question 7. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.639
Find the coordinates of the vertices on the graph of f(x) equals x to

3
00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:18.188
the 4 - 4x to the 3 plus 2x squared plus 4x - 3.

4
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.981
Vertices are local maxima and minima.

5
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:27.681
Use TI-84 CALC > minimum/maximum.

6
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:36.277
Factored: f(x) equals (x-1)^2(x plus 1)(x-3). Zeros

7
00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:41.193
at x equals negative 1. 1. 3.

8
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.711
Local min: (1 - square root of

9
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:50.382
2. negative 4) approximately (-0.41. negative 4)

10
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.798
Local max: (1. 0)

11
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.429
Local min: (1 plus square root of

12
00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:02.646
2. negative 4) approximately (2.41. negative 4)

13
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:12.809
Vertices: (-0.41. negative 4). (1. 0). (2.41. negative 4)

14
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:20.873
IB exam tip: A degree-n polynomial has at most n-1 turning points.
