00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.068
Question 5.3.5. Question 5. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:12.381
Sketch the inverse function of the given graph (y equals

3
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.806
sine(x) from -pi over 2 to pi over 2).

4
00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:21.284
Reflect in y equals x. The inverse

5
00:00:21.384 --> 00:00:25.644
of sine(x) (restricted) is arc sine(x).

6
00:00:25.717 --> 00:00:34.915
Key points: (-pi over 2. negative 1) maps to (-1. -pi over

7
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:42.129
2) and (pi over 2. 1) maps to (1. pi over 2).

8
00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:47.159
The inverse is the arc sine curve from (-1.

9
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.700
-pi over 2) to (1. pi over 2).

10
00:00:52.684 --> 00:00:55.925
IB exam tip: The domain of f becomes

11
00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:59.544
the range of f inverse. and vice versa.
