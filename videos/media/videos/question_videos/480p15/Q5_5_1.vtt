00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.548
Question 5.5.1. Question 1. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:14.992
The subscription fee for an online project management software by AB-Tech is

3
00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:20.316
\$40 per month. If the customer buys for a whole year in

4
00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:26.496
advance. a discount of \$130 is applied. This can be modelled by:

5
00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:31.535
P(n) equals 40n - 130.\ n greater than or equal to 12

6
00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:37.335
where n is the number of months. The subscription price for a

7
00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:43.895
different tool by YZ-Tech is \$35 per month (annual purchase only. no

8
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:51.025
discount). The total subscription cost of YZ-Tech is less than AB-Tech when

9
00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.638
n > k. This question is worth 7 marks.

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.988
Find the total cost of buying a subscription for 2 years. [2 marks]

11
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:08.921
2 years equals 24 months. Substitute n equals 24 into P(n).

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.828
P(24) equals 40(24) - 130 equals 960 - 130 equals 830

13
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:24.798
Total cost equals \$830

14
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:32.025
Find P inverse(1790). [2 marks]

15
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:37.073
Set P(n) equals 1790 and solve for n.

16
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:41.521
40n - 130 equals 1790

17
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.452
40n equals 1920

18
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.473
n equals 48

19
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:51.425
P inverse(1790) equals 48 months

20
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.545
Find the minimum value of k. [3 marks]

21
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:07.478
YZ-Tech cost: Q(n) equals 35n. We need 35n < 40n - 130.

22
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:11.585
35n < 40n - 130

23
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:15.814
negative 5n < negative 130

24
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:19.438
Dividing by negative 5 flips the inequality!

25
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.905
n > 26

26
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.452
Minimum value of k equals 26

27
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.418
IB exam tip: Inequality flips when you divide by a negative.

28
00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.684
This is one of the most common errors in IB exams!
