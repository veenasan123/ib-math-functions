00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
Question 5.2.8. Question 8. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.972
Find the domain of f(x) equals 3x squared - 5x plus 1.

3
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.579
This is a polynomial (quadratic). Polynomials

4
00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.473
are defined for all real numbers.

5
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.505
Domain: x in the real numbers

6
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:31.189
IB exam tip: Quick check: no fractions. no

7
00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.438
roots. no logs → domain is all reals.
