Question 5.5.7. Question 7. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.990
Consider the function y equals x - 12square root of

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.860
x squared - 4. This question is worth 6 marks.

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.028
Sketch the graph of y. [3 marks]

5
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:28.641
Domain: x squared - 4 > 0. so x > 2 or x < negative 2.

6
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:33.913
Vertical asymptotes at x equals 2 and x equals negative 2.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.473
Horizontal asymptotes: as x maps to plus infinity. y maps to

8
00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:45.732
1; as x maps to -infinity. y maps to negative 1.

9
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.791
Sketch with VA at x equals plus or minus 2. HA

10
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:56.548
at y equals plus or minus 1. x-intercept at (12. 0).

11
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.438
Write down the x-intercept. [1 mark]

12
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.180
Set numerator equals 0: x - 12 equals 0 . therefore. x equals 12.

13
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.886
x-intercept: (12. 0)

14
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.140
Write down the equations of all asymptotes. [2 marks]

15
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:25.783
Vertical: x squared - 4 equals 0 . therefore.

16
00:01:25.883 --> 00:01:29.374
x equals 2 and x equals negative 2.

17
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:34.997
Horizontal: y equals 1 (as x maps to plus infinity)

18
00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:40.406
and y equals negative 1 (as x maps to -infinity).

19
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:45.010
VA: x equals 2. x equals negative 2.

20
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.654
HA: y equals 1. y equals negative 1.

21
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.996
IB exam tip: Functions with square root of x squared -

22
00:01:56.096 --> 00:02:01.576
a in the denominator can have different horizontal asymptotes for x

23
00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:05.324
maps to plus infinity vs x maps to -infinity.
