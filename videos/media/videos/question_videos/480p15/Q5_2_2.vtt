00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.732
Question 5.2.2. Question 2. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:11.520
For each of the following graphs. state the domain and range.

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.788
Line with arrows both ends

4
00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:19.628
Straight line with arrows — extends infinitely.

5
00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:25.316
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y in the real numbers

6
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:31.288
Curve with minimum at (-2. 1)

7
00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:36.688
The curve has a minimum point. meaning y values start at 1 and go up.

8
00:00:36.788 --> 00:00:43.168
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y greater than or equal to 1

9
00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:53.134
Polynomial through (-5. 7) and (3. 4) with arrows

10
00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:58.582
With arrows on both sides. both domain and range cover all reals.

11
00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:04.270
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y in the real numbers

12
00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:13.777
IB exam tip: For parabolas: opens up → range y greater than or equal

13
00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:20.621
to vertex; opens down → range y less than or equal to vertex.
