Question 5.4.10. Question 10. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:12.473
Find the root(s) of the equation x to the 3 equals e^x.

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.768
Graph both sides: y equals x to the

4
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:22.380
3 and y equals e^x. then find intersections.

5
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:27.574
Use TI-84 CALC > intersect for each crossing.

6
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:33.734
x approximately 1.86 and x approximately 4.54

7
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:39.456
IB exam tip: "Find the roots" equals "find

8
00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:44.086
the solutions". Graph each side and use intersect.
