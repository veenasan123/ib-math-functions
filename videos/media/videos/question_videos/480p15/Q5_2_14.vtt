Question 5.2.14. Question 14. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:14.065
Find the domain of f(x) equals 3 over x squared - 5x plus 4.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.308
Factor the denominator: x squared - 5x plus 4 equals (x-1)(x-4).

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.452
(x-1)(x-4) not equal to 0

5
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.345
x not equal to 1 and x not equal to 4

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.948
Domain: x in the real numbers.\ x not equal to 1.\ x not equal to 4

7
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:45.211
IB exam tip: Always factor quadratic denominators. Practice

8
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.718
factoring — it saves time in the exam.
