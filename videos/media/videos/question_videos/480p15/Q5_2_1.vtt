00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.732
Question 5.2.1. Question 1. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:11.520
For each of the following graphs. state the domain and range.

3
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:18.111
Line through (-4. 2) with arrows both ends

4
00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:20.282
Arrows on both ends mean the

5
00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:23.596
line extends infinitely in both directions.

6
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:29.543
The x-values cover all real numbers: domain is x in the real numbers.

7
00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:35.212
The y-values cover all real numbers: range is y in the real numbers.

8
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:40.879
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y in the real numbers

9
00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:48.212
Parabola with vertex (3. 2) opening downward

10
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:52.746
A parabola opening downward has a maximum at the vertex.

11
00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.141
Domain: x in the real numbers

12
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:58.892
(parabolas extend infinitely left and right).

13
00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:05.074
Range: y less than or equal to 2 (the vertex is the highest point).

14
00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:11.418
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y less than or equal to 2

15
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:21.170
Line through (1. 6) and (-3. negative 5) with arrows

16
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.823
Arrows mean infinite extension — this is a straight line.

17
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:31.479
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y in the real numbers

18
00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:41.631
IB exam tip: Check for: arrows (infinity). closed dots (less than

19
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:48.660
or equal to/greater than or equal to). open dots (</>).
