00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Question 5.3.7. Question 7. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.145
Sketch the inverse functions of the following graphs.

3
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:17.998
Parabola with vertex (0. 1) opening upward

4
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:26.721
Reflect in y equals x. Vertex (0. 1) maps to (1. 0).

5
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.380
The parabola becomes a sideways parabola opening to the right.

6
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:36.598
Sideways parabola from (1. 0) opening right.

7
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.361
Bell curve with max (0. 3)

8
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:50.598
Reflect in y equals x. Key point (0. 3) maps to (3. 0).

9
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:54.886
Reflected curve with key point (3. 0).

10
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.150
IB exam tip: The inverse of a parabola y equals x squared is

11
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.692
y equals plus or minussquare root of x — a sideways parabola.
