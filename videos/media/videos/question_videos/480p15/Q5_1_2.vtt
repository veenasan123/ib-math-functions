Question 5.1.2. Question 2. Concept of a Function.

2
00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:13.440
For f(x) equals 2x squared - 3x plus 2. find:

3
00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:16.964
f(0)

4
00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:24.201
Substitute x equals 0 into f(x) equals 2x squared - 3x plus 2.

5
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:34.838
f(0) equals 2(0)^2 - 3(0) plus 2 equals 0 - 0 plus 2 equals 2

6
00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.825
f(0) equals 2

7
00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.753
f(3)

8
00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.566
Substitute x equals 3.

9
00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:52.012
f(3) equals 2(3)^2 - 3(3) plus 2 equals 2(9) - 9

10
00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:57.758
plus 2 equals 18 - 9 plus 2 equals 11

11
00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:00.620
f(3) equals 11

12
00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.985
f(-4)

13
00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:10.194
Substitute x equals negative 4. Remember:

14
00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:14.481
(-4)^2 equals 16. not negative 16.

15
00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:23.764
f(-4) equals 2(-4)^2 - 3(-4) plus 2 equals 2(16) plus 12

16
00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:30.601
plus 2 equals 32 plus 12 plus 2 equals 46

17
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:36.902
Common mistake: students write (-4)^2 equals negative 16. The

18
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:41.790
square of a negative number is always positive!

19
00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:45.526
f(-4) equals 46

20
00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:54.350
IB exam tip: When substituting negative numbers into quadratics.

21
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.030
always use brackets: (-4)^2. not negative 4 squared.
