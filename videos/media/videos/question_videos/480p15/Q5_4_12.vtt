Question 5.4.12. Question 12. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:14.406
A manufacturing firm uses the following model for their monthly profit: P equals

3
00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:19.023
9.4q - 0.02q squared - 420 where P is the profit and q

4
00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:24.666
is the number of items produced that month. How many items a month

5
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:29.454
should the firm produce in order to maximize the profit?

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.692
This is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum is at the vertex.

7
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:43.041
For P equals negative 0.02q squared plus 9.4q - 420.

8
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.601
the vertex is at q equals -b over 2a.

9
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:59.254
q equals negative 9.4 over 2(-0.02) equals 9.4 over 0.04 equals 235

10
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:13.216
P(235) equals 9.4(235) - 0.02(235)^2 - 420 equals

11
00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:22.633
2209 - 1104.5 - 420 equals 684.50

12
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:31.854
Produce 235 items per month. Maximum profit equals \$684.50

13
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.100
IB exam tip: Real-world optimization: identify it as a

14
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.600
quadratic. find the vertex. The vertex formula x equals

15
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.100
-b over 2a is on the formula sheet.
