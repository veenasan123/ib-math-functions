Question 5.2.13. Question 13. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.148
Find the domain of f(x) equals x over x squared - 9.

3
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:21.726
Factor the denominator: x squared - 9 equals (x-3)(x plus 3).

4
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.260
(x-3)(x plus 3) not equal to 0

5
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:30.625
x not equal to 3 and x not equal to negative 3

6
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.653
Domain: x in the real numbers.\ x not equal

7
00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.694
to 3.\ x not equal to negative 3

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.621
IB exam tip: Always factor the denominator first — difference of squares

9
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:52.556
a squared - b squared equals (a-b)(a plus b) is very common.
