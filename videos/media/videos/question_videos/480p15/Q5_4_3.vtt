00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.972
Question 5.4.3. Question 3. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.767
Find the horizontal asymptote of f(x) equals x

3
00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:14.625
plus 1 over x squared plus 5.

4
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:22.569
Numerator degree (1) < denominator degree (2).

5
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:27.654
When numerator degree is less. the HA is y equals 0.

6
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.713
Horizontal asymptote: y equals 0

7
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:38.358
IB exam tip: If the numerator has a lower degree than

8
00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:44.054
the denominator. the horizontal asymptote is always y equals 0.
