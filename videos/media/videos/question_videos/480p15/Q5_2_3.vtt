00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.852
Question 5.2.3. Question 3. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:11.582
For each of the following graphs. state the domain and range.

3
00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:18.654
Parabola. vertex at (6. 4) opening down

4
00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:22.446
Opening downward means the vertex is the maximum.

5
00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:28.819
Domain: x in the real numbers. Range: y less than or equal to 4

6
00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:34.222
Bounded curve (closed endpoints)

7
00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:37.422
Look at the leftmost and rightmost x-values

8
00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.102
and the lowest and highest y-values.

9
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.620
Domain and range depend on graph

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.705
endpoints — read coordinates carefully.

11
00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:50.883
Rational function with asymptotes

12
00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:54.271
Rational functions have asymptotes — the graph

13
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:57.291
approaches but never touches these lines.

14
00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:02.275
At vertical asymptotes. exclude that x-value from the domain.

15
00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:07.209
At horizontal asymptotes. exclude that y-value from the range.

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.592
Domain: x in the real numbers. x not equal to vertical asymptote.

17
00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:20.134
Range: y in the real numbers. y not equal to horizontal asymptote.

18
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.954
IB exam tip: For rational functions. check both

19
00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:33.662
vertical asymptotes (domain) and horizontal asymptotes (range).
