Question 5.1.1. Question 1. Concept of a Function.

2
00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:11.880
If f(x) equals 2x plus 5. find:

3
00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.262
f(2)

4
00:00:15.368 --> 00:00:21.868
Substitute x equals 2 into the function f(x) equals 2x plus 5.

5
00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:29.164
f(2) equals 2(2) plus 5 equals 4 plus 5 equals 9

6
00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:32.062
f(2) equals 9

7
00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.020
f(5)

8
00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:42.236
Substitute x equals 5 into f(x) equals 2x plus 5.

9
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:49.929
f(5) equals 2(5) plus 5 equals 10 plus 5 equals 15

10
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.988
f(5) equals 15

11
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:57.481
f(-3)

12
00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:05.406
Substitute x equals negative 3. Remember: 2(-3) equals negative 6.

13
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:14.401
f(-3) equals 2(-3) plus 5 equals negative 6 plus 5 equals negative 1

14
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:18.169
f(-3) equals negative 1

15
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.947
IB exam tip: Always show the substitution step clearly — you

16
00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:29.481
earn method marks for it even if your arithmetic slips.
