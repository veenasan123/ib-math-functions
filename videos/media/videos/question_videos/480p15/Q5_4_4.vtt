00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Question 5.4.4. Question 4. Sketching Graphs.

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:12.744
Find the horizontal asymptote of f(x) equals 2x to the

3
00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:16.521
3 plus 5x plus 7 over 7x squared - 1.

4
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:23.974
Numerator degree (3) > denominator degree (2).

5
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.312
When the numerator has a higher

6
00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:29.414
degree. there is no horizontal asymptote.

7
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.958
No horizontal asymptote.

8
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.586
IB exam tip: No HA when numerator degree

9
00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:42.838
> denominator degree. The function grows without bound.
