00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.260
Question 5.3.6. Question 6. Inverse Functions.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.433
Sketch the inverse function of the given graph

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.972
(line through (0. 4) and (2. 0)).

4
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.633
Reflect the line in y equals x.

5
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:31.193
(0. 4) maps to (4. 0) and (2. 0) maps to (0. 2).

6
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:37.766
Inverse line passes through (4. 0) and (0. 2).

7
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.776
IB exam tip: The inverse of a line is

8
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:47.894
always a line (unless the original is horizontal/vertical).
