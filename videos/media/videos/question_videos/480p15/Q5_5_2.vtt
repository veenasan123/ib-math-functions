Question 5.5.2. Question 2. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:14.097
The circumference. C. of a given circle can be represented by: C(A)

3
00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:19.199
equals 2pisquare root of A over pi where A is the area

4
00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:23.829
of the circle. for 0 less than or equal to A less

5
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.742
than or equal to 24. This question is worth 5 marks.

6
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:34.926
Find the value of C(24). [1 mark]

7
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:40.983
C(24) equals 2pisquare root of 24 over pi

8
00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:47.734
equals 2pi times 2.764... equals 17.4 (3 s.f.)

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.908
C(24) approximately 17.4

10
00:00:55.266 --> 00:01:00.374
Draw the graph of the inverse function C inverse. [3 marks]

11
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:05.305
Reflect the graph of C(A) in the line y equals x.

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:16.796
Key points: (0. 0) stays. (24. 17.4) maps to (17.4. 24).

13
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:20.107
The inverse curves upward (like a parabola)

14
00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:22.982
since the original was a square root.

15
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:30.958
Parabola-like curve from (0. 0) through (17.4. 24).

16
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:39.478
Explain the meaning of C inverse(2pi) equals pi. [1 mark]

17
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.732
Put it in context: C inverse converts circumference to area.

18
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.859
A circle with circumference 2pi has area pi.

19
00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.452
(This is the unit circle. r equals 1.)

20
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.222
IB exam tip: "Explain the meaning" questions: state what the input

21
00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:06.324
represents. what the output represents. and connect them in context.
