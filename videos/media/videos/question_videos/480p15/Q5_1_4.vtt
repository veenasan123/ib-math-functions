Question 5.1.4. Question 4. Concept of a Function.

2
00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:12.960
It is known that f(x) equals 3x - 2. Find x if:

3
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:17.673
f(x) equals 13

4
00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:22.486
Set f(x) equals 13 and solve for x.

5
00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.276
3x - 2 equals 13

6
00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:27.668
3x equals 15

7
00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.588
x equals 5

8
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:31.521
x equals 5

9
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.353
f(x) equals negative 14

10
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:42.609
Set f(x) equals negative 14 and solve for x.

11
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.841
3x - 2 equals negative 14

12
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.441
3x equals negative 12

13
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.873
x equals negative 4

14
00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.340
x equals negative 4

15
00:00:55.301 --> 00:01:00.009
IB exam tip: "Find x if f(x) equals k" means

16
00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.457
solve the equation. Set the function expression equal to k.
