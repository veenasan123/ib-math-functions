00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.068
Question 5.1.5. Question 5. Concept of a Function.

2
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:12.614
Suppose g(x) equals 2x plus 3 over x-4.

3
00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:16.754
Evaluate g(2)

4
00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:23.775
Substitute x equals 2 into g(x) equals 2x plus 3 over x-4.

5
00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:28.906
g(2) equals 2(2) plus 3 over 2-4 equals 7

6
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.919
over negative 2 equals negative 7 over 2

7
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:39.973
g(2) equals negative 7 over 2 equals negative 3.5

8
00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.066
Evaluate g(0)

9
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.933
Substitute x equals 0.

10
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.331
g(0) equals 2(0) plus 3 over 0-4 equals 3

11
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:58.629
over negative 4 equals negative 3 over 4

12
00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:05.335
g(0) equals negative 3 over 4 equals negative 0.75

13
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.935
Find x such that g(x) equals negative 3

14
00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:16.815
Set g(x) equals negative 3 and solve for x.

15
00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:21.159
2x plus 3 over x-4 equals negative 3

16
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:28.589
Multiply both sides by (x-4): 2x plus 3 equals negative 3(x - 4)

17
00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:32.887
2x plus 3 equals negative 3x plus 12

18
00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.162
5x equals 9

19
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:39.229
x equals 9 over 5 equals 1.8

20
00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:47.015
Check: x equals 1.8 not equal to 4. so denominator is not zero. Valid!

21
00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:51.095
x equals 9 over 5 equals 1.8

22
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:57.520
IB exam tip: When solving rational equations. always

23
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.228
verify your answer doesn't make the denominator zero.

24
00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:05.693
If it does. the solution is extraneous.
