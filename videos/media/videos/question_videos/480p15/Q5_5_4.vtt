00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.572
Question 5.5.4. Question 4. Exam Style Questions.

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:14.148
The area. A. of a given square can be represented by: A(P) equals

3
00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:20.074
P squared over 16 where P is the perimeter of the square. for

4
00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:26.001
P greater than or equal to 0. This question is worth 5 marks.

5
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:32.121
Find the value of A(20). [1 mark]

6
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:41.334
A(20) equals (20)^2 over 16 equals 400 over 16 equals 25

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.780
A(20) equals 25

8
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:52.145
Draw the graph of the inverse function A inverse. [3 marks]

9
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.925
Reflect in y equals x. The inverse of P squared

10
00:00:57.025 --> 00:01:01.886
over 16 is A inverse(x) equals 4square root of x.

11
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:11.721
Key points: (0. 0) stays. (20. 25) maps to (25. 20).

12
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.516
Square root curve from (0. 0) through (25. 20).

13
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:26.598
Explain the meaning of A inverse(4) equals 8. [1 mark]

14
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.681
A inverse converts area to perimeter.

15
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:35.321
A square with area 4 cm² has perimeter 8 cm.

16
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:43.071
IB exam tip: For "explain the meaning" questions. always

17
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:49.502
refer back to the real-world context (area. perimeter. etc.).
