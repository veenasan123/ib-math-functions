Question 5.2.11. Question 11. Domain and Range.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.700
Find the domain of f(x) equals 5square root of x - 1.

3
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:18.243
Two restrictions: (1) cannot square root a

4
00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:21.566
negative. (2) cannot divide by zero.

5
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:28.046
x - 1 > 0 (strict inequality because the root is in the denominator)

6
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.905
x > 1

7
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.570
Note: x equals 1 gives square root of 0

8
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.006
equals 0 in the denominator. which is undefined.

9
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.846
Domain: x > 1

10
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.588
IB exam tip: When expr is in a

11
00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:52.420
denominator. use strict inequality: expr > 0.
