00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.592
Section 5.3: Inverse Functions. This is one of

2
00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:08.468
the most tested topics on the IB exam.

3
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:17.314
An inverse function reverses the process. If f of 2 equals 3.

4
00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:22.713
then f inverse of 3 equals 2. The input and output swap.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.940
Here you can see: f takes 2 to 3. and f inverse takes 3 back to 2.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.913
Very important: f inverse is NOT the same as 1 over

7
00:00:34.013 --> 00:00:39.124
f of x. The negative 1 means inverse. not reciprocal!

8
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:48.201
Let's find f inverse of 11 when f of x equals 3x plus 5.

9
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:53.899
Set 3x plus 5 equal to 11 and solve. Subtract 5 to

10
00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.225
get 3x equals 6. Divide by 3 to get x equals 2.

11
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:03.054
Therefore. f inverse of 11 equals 2.

12
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.995
To graph an inverse. we reflect the original

13
00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.254
curve in the line y equals x.

14
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.452
Here is f of x equals e to the x minus 2.

15
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.487
Reflecting in y equals x gives us the inverse: f inverse

16
00:01:23.587 --> 00:01:27.672
of x equals natural log of x plus 2. Notice the

17
00:01:27.772 --> 00:01:32.660
key point 0 comma negative 1 becomes negative 1 comma 0.

18
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:37.953
And the horizontal asymptote of f at y equals negative 2 becomes

19
00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:42.857
a vertical asymptote of the inverse at x equals negative 2.

20
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.253
Here's the big trick. If the exam asks you to solve f of x

21
00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:55.634
equals f inverse of x. just solve f of x equals x instead. This

22
00:01:55.734 --> 00:02:00.588
works because f and f inverse meet on the line y equals x.

23
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:09.633
Example: f of x equals x cubed plus x minus 8. Set it equal to x:

24
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:17.678
x cubed plus x minus 8 equals x. The x terms cancel. giving x cubed equals

25
00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:24.310
8. So x equals 2. The intersection is at the point 2 comma 2.

26
00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:33.080
Remember: f of x equals f inverse of x means solve f of

27
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.974
x equals x. This saves huge time on Paper 1. Write this down!
