00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.148
Section 5.2: Domain and Range. These are two

2
00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:08.108
of the most important ideas in functions.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.732
The domain is the set of all possible x values you can input.

4
00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:20.820
The range is the set of all possible y values the function outputs.

5
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.593
The domain is shown along the x-axis in green.

6
00:00:24.693 --> 00:00:28.254
For this parabola. x can be any real number.

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.986
The range is shown along the y-axis in yellow. This parabola has a maximum at

8
00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:39.676
y equals 4. so the range is y less than or equal to 4.

9
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:48.329
Here are three examples. A straight line has domain and range of

10
00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.735
all real numbers. A parabola opening down has all reals for domain.

11
00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:58.494
but the range is limited by the vertex. A square root curve

12
00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:03.254
starts at a point. so both domain and range are restricted.

13
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.764
Rule 1: You cannot take the square root of a negative number.

14
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.617
For root of x minus 2. we need x minus 2 to

15
00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:20.380
be at least zero. so x must be at least 2.

16
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:27.758
Rule 2: You cannot divide by zero. For 2 over x. x cannot equal zero.

17
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.336
Rule 3: You cannot take the natural log of zero or a

18
00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:36.883
negative number. For ln of x plus 3. we need x plus

19
00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:41.788
3 to be positive. so x must be greater than negative 3.

20
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:50.301
What if a function has more than one restriction? Consider h of

21
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.921
x equals 5 over the square root of x minus 1.

22
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.993
First. the denominator cannot be zero. so x cannot be

23
00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:04.210
1. Second. the expression under the square root must be

24
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.814
non-negative. so x must be at least 1.

25
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:12.806
Combining both restrictions: x must be strictly greater than 1.

26
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.945
IB exam tip: if a function has no fractions. no

27
00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:24.382
square roots. and no logarithms. then the domain is all

28
00:02:24.482 --> 00:02:30.116
real numbers. Polynomials always have domain of all reals.
